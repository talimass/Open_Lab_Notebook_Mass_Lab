  #  <center> Protocol to make an Online Github Notebook

This protocol will guide you through making your own online notebook forked from Jekyll-now. For more information about the original webside layout, click [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). To set up your online notebook, you will need to have the following programs on your computer:
  - Gitbash (for PCs, Macs have Terminal already installed)
  - A Markdown editor (e.g. Atom or MOU)

# <center> Steps:

## 1. Fork The Repository from [Putnam_Lab_Notebook](https://github.com/hputnam/Putnam_Lab_Notebook) or [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
